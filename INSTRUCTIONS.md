# Instructions for Fixing Website Issues

This document contains instructions for resolving the identified issues with the Information Analysis Tools Directory website.

## 1. Update UI Components

We've made these changes to fix the navigation bar display and improve the tool card component:

- Updated the `Tag.tsx` component to display categories in a more organized grid layout
- Enhanced `WebNavCard.tsx` to handle missing images and display fallback icons
- Improved the tool detail page to provide English content even when database content is in Chinese

## 2. Fix Database Content Issues

To update the database with proper English content for all tools, run the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Login to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and execute the content from `db/supabase/update_english_content.sql`

This script:
- Updates specific tools with proper English descriptions
- Replaces any Chinese content with appropriate English alternatives
- Ensures consistency across the website

## 3. Verify Website Fixes

After applying these changes and running the SQL script, restart your development server and verify:

1. The navigation categories should display properly in a grid layout
2. Tool cards should show images or fallback icons when images are missing
3. All content should be in proper English, with no Chinese text
4. Tool detail pages should display meaningful English descriptions

## 4. Additional Notes

- If some images are still not displaying, check your image URLs in the database
- You may need to add more specific English descriptions for additional tools not covered in the update script
- Consider adding more default thumbnail images for tools that don't have valid image URLs

## 5. Running Development Server

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Open in browser
http://localhost:3000
```

These changes should ensure the website functions properly as an English-language information analysis tools directory.
